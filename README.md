# Crystal-Ball---Assembly-Language-Program
The Crystal Ball assembly language program offers an interactive experience where users can consult a virtual crystal ball for answers to their questions. Written entirely in 16-bit assembly language, this program offers an interactive and visually engaging experience for users.

Features:

Interactive Mode Selection: Users can choose between two modes: "Thinking Mode" and "Text Mode." Each mode offers a distinct way to interact with the program.
Thinking Mode: In this mode, users have a limited time to think of a question. The crystal ball then provides a random answer.
Text Mode: Users can input their question directly into the text display. The crystal ball responds with a random answer.
Visually Appealing Interface: The program utilizes ASCII symbols and colors to create a visually appealing representation of a crystal ball.
Randomized Answers: The crystal ball provides a range of randomized answers to questions, adding an element of unpredictability to the experience.
Instruction Pages: Clear instructions are provided to guide users on how to interact with the program effectively.

How to Run:

Download and install a 16-bit assembly language simulator capable of running at a speed of 50kHz.
Load the provided assembly code into the simulator.
Run the simulation to start the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the crystal ball.

Compatibility:

This program is designed to run on a 16-bit assembly language simulator operating at a speed of 50kHz. Ensure that your simulator meets these requirements for optimal performance.
